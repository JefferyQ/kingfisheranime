**About**
<br />
This program links in to [Konachan's](http://konachan.com) API allowing you to view and download Wallpapers and other art hosted on Konachan. Konachan's Library will download the image save it as the tag you pick and it's ID number. It will then download it in to it's own folder keeping everything clean and you can also check your folder within the program by clicking the My Library button, this won't just open a window it will open Konachan's Library: My Library viewer and enable you to view the image, open it in another program, and other things like rename it and delete it.

This program is fan based and has no link to [konachan.com](http://Konachan.com), the program utilizes their API, the program itself is by me; KingFisherAnime and [Shadiku](http://code.google.com/p/kingfisheranime/wiki/Shadiku).
